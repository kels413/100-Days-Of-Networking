Lets Talk bout Computer Networking.

in the olden days how do we communicate with one another ??

we communicate using mouth right ?? that's possible when the person we want to communicate with is close to us, buh imagine that person is far from you how can you do, let's take for instance, you are in one room and the person you want to communicate is in another room how can communication be possible ??, its either you both use microphone right?? ðŸ˜‚, buh now you have to know that your conversation is very very private in the sense that you are the only hearing what you both are conversing right??, even tho you are making use of Microphone's with very long cable like river Nile.

In that Scenario communication is possible right ??, buh how bout when we want to communicate to somebody far from us ?? like somebody living in another country ?? communication would not be possible right ??, so this was a very difficult period for the world to communicate, so they had to find a way to solve that problem, that Led to the Invention or discovery of Networking. 
P:S I don't want to start going into the whole boring stories that Led into Invention and how ComNetworking came bout.
